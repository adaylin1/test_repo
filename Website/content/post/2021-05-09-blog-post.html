<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Python and R are both programming languages that are extremely useful for data wrangling and analysis, especially in the realm of computational biology and bioinformatics. Although many think of these different coding languages (or coding in general) as boring and difficult to understand, I decided to introduce a little bit of humor to showcase the fun side of coding below!</p>

<h2>R and Python</h2>
<p>I will be starting in R by assigning the follow string of characters to <code>TheBestest</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
TheBestest &lt;- &quot;Fearless (Taylor&#39;s Version) by Taylor Swift&quot;</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, Ungodly Hour is indeed the best album of 2020.</p>
<p>Next, I will be switching to python, and save a different string of characters as <code>Truth</code>. Then, I am going to print out these strings together in the same python code chunk by using the print function.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>Fact = &quot;is the best version of Fearless.&quot;
print(r.TheBestest, Fact)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Fearless (Taylor&#39;s Version) by Taylor Swift is the best version of Fearless.</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, Fearless (Taylor’s Version) is indeed the best version of Fearless.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>R and Python, or any kind of coding system, can be fun if you go out of your way to try new things out. And, the most important part and biggest takeaway of this whole blog post is understanding that Fearless (Taylor’s Version) is indeed the best version of Fearless and that is a FACT!!</p>
